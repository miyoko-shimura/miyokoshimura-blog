Bitcoin ― the pioneer of blockchain technology has captured the world’s attention with its decentralized and immutable nature.

Yet, as its popularity grows, so does the need for scalability.

The mantra of “bigger blocks” has been thought as a popular solution to Bitcoin’s scalability challenges. Enlarging block size has been a hot debate for years.

## What is Block Size?

Block size refers to the maximum amount of data that can be stored in one block on a blockchain. Bitcoin’s block size is defined in the Bitcoin protocol. Each block in the blockchain contains a set of transactions and other metadata.

Different blockchains have different block size limits, which are typically defined by the consensus rules of the network.

## Block Size Debate

Block size is a key factor in determining the scalability of a blockchain. Some people believe that block size should be increased to accommodate more transaction data.

Others believe that the block size should be kept small to maintain decentralization and security, as Satoshi Nakamoto originally intended.

:::caution
HTML attributes will be converted to strings, so it is not possible to pass functions and objects to HTML elements.
For example, you can't assign an event handler to an HTML element in an Astro component:

```astro
---
// dont-do-this.astro
function handleClick() {
	console.log('button clicked!')
}
---

<!-- ❌ This doesn't work! ❌ -->
<button onClick={handleClick}>Nothing will happen when you click me!</button>
```

Instead, use a client-side script to add the event handler, like you would in vanilla JavaScript:

```astro
---
// do-this-instead.astro
---

<button id='button'>Click Me</button>
<script>
	function handleClick() {
		console.log('button clicked!')
	}
	document.getElementById('button').addEventListener('click', handleClick)
</script>
```
