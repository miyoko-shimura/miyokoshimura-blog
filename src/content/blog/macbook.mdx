This article explains how to encrypt and decrypt messages using RSA public key cryptography in Python, using the pycryptodome library for the implementation.

RSA allows secure transmission of data using **a key pair of public and private keys**. I think a grasp of RSA isn’t only crucial for data security but also provides insights into the principles of cryptography.

## Overview of RSA Algorithm

RSA is a public-key cryptography algorithm developed 1970’s by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman at MIT. RSA was publicly described in 1977 and the algorithm patented. The patent expired in 2000 allowing free public use.

RSA is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm which enables secure data transmission using a public and private key pair. RSA was initially slow compared to symmetric ciphers but improved over time.

### RSA Use Cases

- **Secure Communication**: TLS/SSL encryption for internet security.
- **Digital Signatures**: Verifies document authenticity through digital signatures.
- **Secure Email**: Encrypts and verifies emails for confidentiality.
- **File Transfer Security**: Ensures secure and verified file transfers.
- **SSL/TLS Certificates**: Integral for securing websites and online transactions.
- **VPN Security**: Establishes secure communication in virtual private networks.
- **Authentication**: Used in smart cards for secure user authentication.

## Setting Up Python Environment with “pycryptodome”
First, we set up a Python environment with the necessary library for cryptographic operations and use the “pycryptodome” library built upon the now-deprecated “PyCrypto.”

### Step 1: Installing libraries in Python
The pycryptodome library serves as a comprehensive Python package of low-level cryptographic primitives. To install it, run the following commands.

```python
# Step 1: Install pycryptodome package
!pip install pycryptodome

# Import necessary modules from pycryptodome
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP

# This module converts binary data to hexadecimal
from binascii import hexlify
```

### Step 2: Generating RSA Key Pair
After setting up your Python environment, generate an RSA key pair. In this example, we’ll use a 1024-bit key.

```python
# Step 2: Generate new RSA key
# Create an RSA key pair with a key size of 1024 bits
key = RSA.generate(1024)

# Set the private_key variable to the generated key
private_key = key

# Derive the public key from the generated key
public_key = key.publickey()
```

### Step 3: Encrypting Data with Public Key
In this example, we’ll encrypt the message “Hello, this is a message to be encrypted.”

```python
# Step3: Encrypt using public key
# Create a PKCS1_OAEP cipher object with the public key for encryption
data_to_encrypt = b"Hello, this is a message to be encrypted."
cipher_rsa = PKCS1_OAEP.new(public_key)

# Encrypt the provided data using the public key
encrypted = cipher_rsa.encrypt(data_to_encrypt)

# Convert binary data to hexadecimal for display using hexlify
print("Encrypted:", hexlify(encrypted))
```

### Step 4 : Decrypting Data with Private Key

```python
# Step4: Decrypt using private key
# Create a PKCS1_OAEP cipher object with the private key for decryption
cipher_rsa = PKCS1_OAEP.new(private_key)
decrypted = cipher_rsa.decrypt(encrypted)

# Display the decrypted result as a UTF-8 encoded string
print("Decrypted:", decrypted.decode("utf-8"))v

```


- **Variable names must be capitalized.** For example, use `Element`, not `element`. Otherwise, Astro will try to render your variable name as a literal HTML tag.

- **Hydration directives are not supported.** When using [`client:*` hydration directives](/en/core-concepts/framework-components/#hydrating-interactive-components), Astro needs to know which components to bundle for production, and the dynamic tag pattern prevents this from working.

### Fragments

Astro supports using either `<Fragment> </Fragment>` or the shorthand `<> </>`.

Fragments can be useful to avoid wrapper elements when adding [`set:*` directives](/en/reference/directives-reference/#sethtml), as in the following example:

```astro title="src/components/SetHtml.astro" "Fragment"
---
const htmlString = '<p>Raw HTML content</p>'
---

<Fragment set:html={htmlString} />
```

### Differences between Astro and JSX

Astro component syntax is a superset of HTML. It was designed to feel familiar to anyone with HTML or JSX experience, but there are a couple of key differences between `.astro` files and JSX.

#### Attributes

In Astro, you use the standard `kebab-case` format for all HTML attributes instead of the `camelCase` used in JSX. This even works for `class`, which is not supported by React.

```jsx del={1} ins={2} title="example.astro"
<div className="box" dataValue="3" />
<div class="box" data-value="3" />
```

#### Multiple Elements

An Astro component template can render multiple elements with no need to wrap everything in a single `<div>` or `<>`, unlike JavaScript or JSX.

```astro title="src/components/RootElements.astro"
---
// Template with multiple elements
---

<p>No need to wrap elements in a single containing element.</p>
<p>Astro supports multiple root elements in a template.</p>
```
